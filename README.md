# Premier League Calendar <img align="left" src="https://github.com/IcaroBernardes/premier-calendar/assets/7217965/7bceb5b2-f8d1-4dda-891d-be0a3807c74e" alt="" width="200">

The Premier League started in 1992 as a schism of 22 teams from the English Football League. Since its inception, it has been the main league of England. In 1995 the league arrived at its current format with 38 turns and 20 clubs. This page shows a circular calendar of matches for all 48 clubs that participated in the league at least once since 1995.

## How this project came to be

I did a version of this circular Calendar of matches in Portuguese for the Brazilian League: [O calendário do Brasileirão](https://icarobernardes.github.io/calendario-brasileirao/). My idea back then was to test how much interactivity I could do in R without Shiny. This involved:

- Creating interactive plots with {ggiraph};
- Creating parameterized HTML pages with Quarto;
- Using R as support to creating JS objects;
- Creating pages with HTML+CSS+JS;
- Hosting with GH Actions.

I will eventually shine more light on the steps I have taken to build this project.
